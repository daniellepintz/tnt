Project Structure
=======================

TorchTNT has two main components, which are the top-level modules of the repo:

1. :mod:`torchtnt.framework`: contains a lightweight training framework to simplify maintaining training, evaluation, and prediction loops.
2. :mod:`torchtnt.utils`: contains a grab-bag of various independent, training-related utilities, including data related abstractions and wrappers around different publishers to simplify logging metrics.
